Notes
-----
  - The program showcases many aspects and tools of the C++ language; These include:  
  -Doubly linked lists to store seating information  
  -The use of overloaded operators to provide linked lists "indexing"  
  -Classes  
  -Structs to store sales information  
  -Input validation  
  -Random file manipulation  
  -String parsing  
  - The seating charts are contained in the files "A1, A2, and A3" for each respective auditorium.  
  -In the .txt files, #'s represent available seats and .'s represent reserved seats.  
  - The best available seats are consecutive for multiple seats. The best position is evaluated by the distance from the center. The center is evaluated using integer division.
  - The sales report only reflects the reservations made during the current run of the program.
