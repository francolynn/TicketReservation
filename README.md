Description
-----------
This C++ program allows user to view seating chart, reserve tickets, suggest best seats and view the sales report. The front-end portion of the program is displayed on the terminal. The seating charts are read from .txt files, and the sales report is outputted to a .txt file.

Notes
-----
  - The program showcases many aspects and tools of the C++ language; These include:  
  -Doubly linked lists to store seating information  
  -The use of overloaded operators to provide linked lists "indexing"  
  -Classes  
  -Structs to store sales information  
  -Input validation  
  -Random file manipulation  
  -String parsing  
  - The best available seats are consecutive for multiple seats. The best position is evaluated by the distance from the center. The center is evaluated using integer division.
